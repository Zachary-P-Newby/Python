This uses Pandas dataframes, has a gui made from tkinter, and displays graphs use matplotlib.pyplot.show(), 
so I have not been able to find a way to test it using pytest. 
So instead, I have included a .csv file I used frequently in testing. 
I worked approximately 6 hours, including the time spent trying to figure out a way to test it using pytest.

I hope this is satisfactory. -Zach Newby
