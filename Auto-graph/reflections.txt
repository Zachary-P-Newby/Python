Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

Well, working on my final project Auto-Graph, and being able to make graphs, GUIs, and and dataframes using libraries showed how powerful functions could be.
I can't really think of just one expirence, but working with me team on group assignments was another time where I saw the power of functions.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
They are extremely useful for testing functions that should return one output for each input.
This way you can make sure functions that preform mathmatical operations, operations on strings, and are reuseable work properly and do not break your program.

One thing I learned this semester is that if just one thing is wrong, it can mess up the whole program, so being able to easily test it and find errors is useful.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

I just run the program, or a specific section, and see if it works how I want it to.
If it does great, if it doesn't I will alter somethin and repeat until it does.

I need to use pytest test functions more, as with my final project whenever I tried to use them, it said pandas could not work with them,
and they don't work with graphical results.
