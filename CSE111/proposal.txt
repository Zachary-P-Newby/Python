CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
	Auto-Graph

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
	Auto-Graph will be a piece of data-visualization software for .csv files, excel spreadhseets, etc. It automatically graphs them for you. Hence the name Auto-Graph 

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
	How to use multiple python modules, process user inputted files, and create a standalone (no code editor needed to run) program.
4. What Python modules will your program use?

    pandas, matplotlib, numpy, tkinter, and datetime. (Numpy and datetime are here because pandas uses them.) Any modules required by the ones listed will be used as well.

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?


	Yes, users input a file, then select which functions to use the file it. Graphing functions, histogram functions, etc.
	
	PROCESS fucntions will process data and make graphs (re-useable), the graphs will then be displayed by DISPLAY functions (less re-useable.)


6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

Yes, PROCESS funtions will tested by PYTEST by comparing their output to an expected output.
