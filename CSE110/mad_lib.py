#Story

The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very\n{adjective} {animal} {verb_1} down the hallway. "{exclamation}!" I yelled. But all\nI could think to do was to {verb_2} over and over. Miracuously,\nthat caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb_3}\nright in front of my famiy.

#rest of the story

Next thing I knew, the {noun} patrol were everwhere,
they were {adverb} trying to catch the {animal} and take it back to the {city} zoo.
The {noun} patrol officers were {verb_4}ing everywhere, {plural_noun} were on the floor, and I was right in the middle of it all.
I guess I looked {adjective_2}, so the {noun} patrol took me in for questioning.

At their {adjective_3} headquarters I was accused of {animal} smuggling and liberating the {animal}
from the {city} zoo. I tried to explain but the {adjective_4} lieutenant would not listen.
I might have ended up in prision had  it not been for the {adjective_5} Hongo the Anti-Lawyer who burst in and cleared my name.
I have to go to the {place} now, but I will tell you the rest of my {adjective_6} story tommorrow.
Mainly the part about the {adjective_7} {noun_2} it's {verb_5}in' time, and {verb_5}ing all over the place.
