# Welcome!

## Note to Intructor:
I reviewed the course materials and used them as reference for creating my lessons. I tried to make my own versions of the linked list and tree from memory for the practice files, but I did view and borrow snippets from the course files to complete. (Bits of code, doc strings, etc. I figured it would be alright for the practice files since they are not required, but made s)

This is the **Zach Newby Data Structure tutorial series!** Here you will find tutorials on **three** data structures commonly used in programming.

1. [Stacks](https://github.com/Zachary-P-Newby/Python/blob/Programming-With-Data-Structures-Fall-2023/data_structure_tutorials/stacks.md)
2. [Linked Lists](https://github.com/Zachary-P-Newby/Python/blob/Programming-With-Data-Structures-Fall-2023/data_structure_tutorials/linked_lists.md)
3. [Trees](https://github.com/Zachary-P-Newby/Python/blob/Programming-With-Data-Structures-Fall-2023/data_structure_tutorials/trees.md)

These tutorials will give a brief explanation of each data structure and how you how to create and use them in Python. There are also three practice files for you to use as you follow along the tutorials, each tutorial will contain a link to it's associated practice file.

This tutorial series is was created for final project the BYUI Programming with Data structures class CSE 212, the turtorials are based lessons from the class but should not be considered a replacement for that class.

I hope you have a good time learning. Good luck and remember to practice!
