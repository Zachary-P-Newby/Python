# Welcome!
This is the ==Zach Newby Data Structure tutorial series!== Here you will find tutorials on **three** data structures commonly used in programming.

1. [Stacks](https://github.com/Zachary-P-Newby/Python/blob/Programming-With-Data-Structures-Fall-2023/data_structure_tutorials/stacks.md)
2. [Linked Lists](https://github.com/Zachary-P-Newby/Python/blob/Programming-With-Data-Structures-Fall-2023/data_structure_tutorials/linked_lists.md)
3. [Trees](https://github.com/Zachary-P-Newby/Python/blob/Programming-With-Data-Structures-Fall-2023/data_structure_tutorials/trees.md)

These tutorials will give a brief explanation of each data structure and how you how to create and use them in Python. There are also three practice files for you to use as you follow along the tutorials, each tutorial will contain a link to it's associated practice file.
