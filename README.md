# Python
Zach Newby's Python Repository

This is a public repository for all of my Python projects and school assignments. They are shared here as a portfolio demonstrating my python programming skills.

Be sure to check the different branches, as some projects are not stored on the main branch, but given their own seperate branch, such as the files from my programming with data structures class.
