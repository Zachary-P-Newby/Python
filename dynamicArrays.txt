Fixed arrays are collections of data with a set capacity, where each piece of data is the same size and next to eachother in memory. Fixed arrays are immutable.

The position of each element in memory can be calculated based off of the location of index zero in memory

Dynamic arrays are mutable, meaning they can grow and shrink, being at less than full capacity, or if max capacity is exceeded, the old array is replaced with a new one.

If an array exceeds its capacity, it enters an overflow state and risks overwriting other data on the computer.

Use the scientific method when solving problems when programming.

1. Identify problem
2. Research solution
3. test research
4. Hypothisize solution
5. Integrate solution and evalulate it
6a. solution works continue on merry way.
6b. Solution fails, research new solution

Not using method can be sloppy, dangerous, careless, or worse.
